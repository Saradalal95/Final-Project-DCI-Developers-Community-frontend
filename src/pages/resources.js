              option to pay for a “Coursera Verified Certificate” (prices range
              between $30-$100) to prove course completion. Sometimes paying for
              a certificate also grants access to content not available in the

              collections of courses on a specific topic, typically with a
              capstone project at the end. What free coding courses they offer:
